  <p ion-text color="femi2">Civic reactors can be young, old, beginners, experts, programmers, designers, data scientists, good communicators, civic organisers, entrepreneurs, employers, employees and unemployed. Actually anyone willing to get his or her hands dirty solving 
    problems who collaborate on co-creating solutions as a response to social, environmental and economic challenges relevant to their city.</p>
  <p ion-text color="femi2">Following the goals of the open data movement are similar to those of other "open" movements such as open source, open hardware, open content and open access and making these things available and usable information for all.</p>
